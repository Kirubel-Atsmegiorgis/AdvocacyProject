      <h2 class="green">What is Diabetes?</h2>
      <p>Diabetes is a chronic health condition that affects how your body turns food into energy. It involves problems with the hormone insulin, which regulates blood sugar levels. There are two main types of diabetes.</p>

      <h4>Type 1 Diabetes</h4> 
      <p>Diabetes is an autoimmune condition where the body's immune system mistakenly attacks and destroys the insulin-producing beta cells in the pancreas. This leads to little or no insulin production, a hormone crucial for regulating blood sugar levels. Without insulin, glucose cannot enter cells to be used for energy, causing high levels of glucose in the blood. This condition often develops in childhood or adolescence, but it can occur at any age. Symptoms include increased thirst, frequent urination, fatigue, and unexplained weight loss. Type 1 diabetes requires lifelong insulin therapy, which can be administered through injections or an insulin pump. Managing blood sugar levels involves regular monitoring, a balanced diet, and physical activity. Despite being a chronic condition, with proper management, individuals with type 1 diabetes can lead healthy and active lives.          </p></div>
      <div>
      <h4>Type 2 Diabetes</h4>
      <p>
        Type 2 diabetes is a chronic condition characterized by the body's inability to effectively use insulin, known as insulin resistance, or by the pancreas not producing enough insulin. This results in elevated blood sugar levels, which can lead to various health complications if not managed properly. Unlike type 1 diabetes, type 2 typically develops in adults over the age of 45, though it is increasingly being diagnosed in younger individuals, including children. Common symptoms include increased thirst, frequent urination, fatigue, and slow-healing sores. Management of type 2 diabetes often involves lifestyle changes such as a healthy diet, regular physical activity, and weight management. In addition, medications or insulin therapy may be required to help control blood sugar levels. With proper care, individuals with type 2 diabetes can manage their condition effectively and reduce the risk of complications. Early detection and intervention are crucial in preventing the progression of the disease and maintaining a good quality of life.

      <h4> Gestational Diabetes</h4>
      <p>Gestational diabetes is a form of diabetes that develops during pregnancy and usually resolves after childbirth. It occurs when the body cannot produce enough insulin to meet the increased needs of pregnancy, leading to elevated blood sugar levels. This condition often has no noticeable symptoms but can be detected through routine screening tests during prenatal care. Women with gestational diabetes are at a higher risk of developing type 2 diabetes later in life, and the condition can also pose risks to the baby, such as excessive birth weight and preterm birth. Management of gestational diabetes involves monitoring blood sugar levels, adopting a healthy diet, engaging in regular physical activity, and sometimes taking insulin or other medications. Proper management is essential to ensure a healthy pregnancy and reduce complications for both mother and baby. After delivery, blood sugar levels typically return to normal, but follow-up testing is important to monitor for potential development of type 2 diabetes. Early detection and treatment are crucial to maintaining the health of both mother and child during and after pregnancy.</p></div>

      <ul>
        <p>In 2021, approximately 29.7 million people of all ages in the U.S. had been diagnosed with diabetes.</p>
        <p>This figure represents around 8.9% of the total U.S. population.</p>
        <p>Among children and adolescents under 20 years old, 352,000 had been diagnosed with diabetes.</p>
        <p>This is equivalent to about 35 per 10,000 U.S. youths.</p>
